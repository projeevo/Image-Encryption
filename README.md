- **Real-time Processing**: Fast encryption and decryption with visual feedback

## üîê How It Works

### 2D Logistic Map Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated 2D Logistic Map, which is a chaotic system that provides excellent security properties:

1. **Chaotic Sequence Generation**: 
   - x<sub>n+1</sub> = r‚ÇÅ √ó x<sub>n</sub> √ó (1 - x<sub>n</sub>) + Œ≤ √ó y<sub>n</sub>¬≤
   - y<sub>n+1</sub> = r‚ÇÇ √ó y<sub>n</sub> √ó (1 - y<sub>n</sub>) + Œ± √ó x<sub>n</sub>¬≤

2. **Pixel Permutation**: The chaotic x-sequence creates a permutation of pixel positions

3. **Pixel Diffusion**: The chaotic y-sequence generates a mask for XOR diffusion

4. **RGB Channel Processing**: Each color channel is processed independently

### Security Features

- **High Entropy**: Chaotic maps ensure maximum randomness
- **Key Sensitivity**: Tiny parameter changes produce completely different results
- **Visual Security**: Encrypted images appear as random noise
- **Perfect Recovery**: Original images are restored exactly without loss

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Image-Encryption
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No image provided" error**
   - Ensure you're uploading a valid image file (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP)

2. **"Invalid ZIP file" error**
   - Make sure you're uploading the correct `encrypted_package.zip` file
   - Don't modify the ZIP file contents

3. **Slow processing**
   - Large images may take longer to process
   - Ensure you have sufficient RAM available

4. **Browser compatibility**
   - Use modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Enable JavaScript in your browser

### Performance Tips

- **Image size**: Smaller images process faster
- **Browser**: Use the latest version of your browser
